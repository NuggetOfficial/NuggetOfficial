Iâ€™m Tom van der Wielen.
My main interests lie in Astronomy and Instrumentation. Specifically imaging techniques. Anything from Synthetic Aperture Radar in radio to Vector Vortex Coronagraphy in the visual and infra-red!
Currently, I'm learning about telescopes and optical/radio systems. I especially love learning about the applications of polarimetry. I'm also avid about getting better at making reusable code.
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Astronomical computational programming problems, Space research and scientific simulations!
